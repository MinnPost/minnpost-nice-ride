                           Routino : Installation
                           ======================


Compilation
-----------

   This program has been written to run on Linux, no cross-platform
   compatibility has been specifically included but on the other hand
   nothing platform specific has been knowingly included either.

   Any information on improving the compilation process on anything other
   than 32-bit x86 Linux is welcome.

   No external libraries are required and the programs are written in
   standard C language.

   To compile the programs just type 'make'.


Installation
------------

   After compilation the executable files are copied into the directory
   web/bin and the default XML configuration files are copied into the
   directory web/data. This is in preparation for using the supplied
   example web pages but is also a useful location to copy the files from
   for normal use.

   The executable files are called 'planetsplitter', 'router' and
   'filedumper' (also 'tagmodifier' for debugging tag modifications). They
   can be copied to any location and need no special installation
   environment.

   The default configuration files are called 'profiles.xml',
   'tagging.xml' and 'translations.xml'. The names of the configuration
   files can be specified on the command line but by default are also
   looked for in the directory that contains the routing database.


Example Web Page
----------------

   The directory 'web' contains a set of files that can be used to create
   a working set of web pages with interfaces to the routing algorithm.

   The files in the 'web' directory will require copying to a location
   that is accessible by a web server. After copying the files some of
   them need to be edited; search through the files for lines that contain
   the words "EDIT THIS" and make appropriate edits. The files that need
   editing are 'paths.pl' (to set the directory paths) and 'router.js' and
   'visualiser.js' to limit the range of the visible map (latitude,
   longitude and zoom).


Configuration of web files
--------------------------

   The assumption in this description is that the whole of the directory
   called web is copied into a directory that is accessible by an Apache
   web server.

    **************************************************************************
    **** This is not a secure configuration but an easy one to configure. ****
    **** Only the directory 'www' should be accessible by the web server. ****
    **** Do not use this configuration unmodified in a public web server. ****
    **************************************************************************

   The directory structure is as follows:

   web/
    |
    + /bin/                    <- The Routino executable files (when compiled).
    |
    + /data/                   <- The Routino database and default configuration
    |                             files.
    |
    + /results/                <- An empty directory to store the results.
    |
    + /www/                    <- The files that must be available to the web
        |                         server are below this level.
        |
        + /openlayers/         <- A directory to hold the OpenLayers scripts.
        |
        + /routino/            <- The main HTML, Javascript, CSS and CGI files.
            |
            + /documentation/  <- The HTML version of the Routino documentation.


   The directory 'bin' will be filled by running the compilation process.
   For a secure installation the 'bin' directory should be outside of the
   web server, the file 'www/routino/paths.pl' contains the path to the
   'bin' directory.

   The directory 'data' must contain the Routino database and is also the
   default location for the configuration files. The routing database is
   created by downloading the OSM files for the region of interest and
   running the 'planetsplitter' program. There is a script in the
   directory that will download the OSM files and create the required
   database. The script should be edited to set the names of the files to
   be downloaded.  For a secure installation the 'data' directory should
   be outside of the web server, the file 'www/routino/paths.pl' contains
   the path to the 'data' directory.

   The directory 'results' is a temporary directory that it used to hold
   the GPX and text files generated by the Routino router. The directory
   must be writable by the web server process since it is the CGI scripts
   that are run by the web server that writes the results here. For a
   secure installation the results directory should be outside of the web
   server, the file 'www/routino/paths.pl' contains the path to the
   results directory.

   The directory 'www' and its sub-directories are the only ones that need
   to be within the web server accessible directory.

   The directory 'www/openlayers' must be filled with the openlayers
   Javascript library that can be downloaded from
   http://www.openlayers.org/.  (This version of Routino has been tested
   with OpenLayers library version 2.11). The files must be installed so
   that the file 'www/openlayers/OpenLayers.js' and the directories
   'www/openlayers/img/', 'www/openlayers/theme/' all exist. There is a
   script in the directory that will automatically download the files,
   create an optimised "OpenLayers.js" and copy the files to the required
   locations.

   The directory 'www/routino' contains the main HTML, Javascript and CSS
   files as well as the CGI scripts that perform the server-side routing
   functions. The description below lists all of the files that contain
   editable information.

   paths.pl
          This contains the names of the directories that contain the
          executable files, router database and temporary results.

   router.pl
          This file contains the filename prefix for the routing database
          files (only needed if planetsplitter is run with the --prefix
          option).

   mapprefs.js
          The parameters in this file control the boundary of the visible
          map (defaults to UK), the minimum and maximum zoom levels
          (defaults to between 4 and 15 inclusive) and the source of map
          tiles (defaults to the main OpenStreetMap tile server).

   The directory www/routino/documentation contains the HTML version of
   the Routino documentation.


Configuration of web server
---------------------------

   The file 'www/routino/.htaccess' contains all of the Apache
   configuration options that are required to get the example web pages
   running. The only problem is that because of the way that the
   "AllowOverride" option works one of the configuration options has been
   commented out. This must be enabled in the main Apache server
   configuration file.
