<h2><a name="H_1_1"></a>Data</h2>

A good router relies on good data and the
<a class="ext" title="OpenStreetMap" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>
data is a good source.  There are however a number of things that need to be
considered about
<a href="data.html" title="Data considerations">the data used</a>.


<h2><a name="H_1_2"></a>Tagging</h2>

In addition to the raw data the way that are tags are used is also important.
With Routino the
<a title="Tagging" href="tagging.html">tagging rules</a>
are contained in a configuration file and can easily be customised to change the
interpretation of each tag.


<h2><a name="H_1_3"></a>Program Usage</h2>

There are four programs that make up this software, two create the routing
database and use the information in it and the other two perform additional functions.
<a href="usage.html" title="Program Usage">Full instructions</a>
for using the four programs are provided.


<h2><a name="H_1_4"></a>Configuration Files</h2>

When the programs are run they read in one or more
<a href="configuration.html" title="Configuration Files">configuration files</a>.
These files contain information about the routing preferences (types of highways,
preferred speeds etc), tagging rules and translation information for the outputs.


<h2><a name="H_1_5"></a>Output Files</h2>

The final result of running the router is one or more
<a href="output.html" title="Output Files">output files</a>
that contain the calculated route.


<h2><a name="H_1_6"></a>Algorithm</h2>

The <a title="Algorithm" href="algorithm.html">algorithm</a> that is used by
Routino takes the OpenStreetMap data and creates a local database of the
important information for rapid routing.


<h2><a name="H_1_7"></a>Installation</h2>

The Routino source code comes with a set of files that can be used to create
a working server very easily.  The full information about
<a href="installation.html" title="Installation">installation</a>
describes how to compile the programs and install them.
