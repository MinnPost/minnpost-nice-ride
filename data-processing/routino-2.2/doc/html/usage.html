<h2><a name="H_1_1"></a>Program Usage</h2>

There are four programs that make up this software.  The first one takes the
planet.osm datafile from OpenStreetMap (or other source of data using the same
formats) and converts it into a local database.  The second program uses the
database to determine an optimum route between two points.  The third program
allows visualisation of the data and statistics to be extracted.  The fourth
program is a test program for the tag transformations.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_1"></a>planetsplitter</h3>

This program reads in the OSM format XML file and splits it up to create the
database that is used for routing.

                      [&lt;filename.osm&gt; ...]
</pre>

<dl>
  <dt>--help
  <dd>Prints out the help information.
  <dt>--dir=&lt;dirname&gt;
  <dd>Sets the directory name in which to save the results.
    Defaults to the current directory.
  <dt>--prefix=&lt;name&gt;
  <dd>Sets the filename prefix for the files that are created.
    Defaults to no prefix.
  <dt>--sort-ram-size=&lt;size&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the amount of RAM (in MB) to use for sorting the data.  If not
    specified then 64 MB will be used in slim mode or 256 MB otherwise.
  <dt>--tmpdir=&lt;dirname&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the name of the directory to store the temporary disk files.  If
    not specified then it defaults to either the value of the --dir option or the
    current directory.
  <dt>--tagging=&lt;filename&gt;
  <dd>Sets the filename containing the list of tagging rules in XML format for
    the parsing the input files.  If the file doesn't exist then dirname, prefix
    and "profiles.xml" will be combined and used, if that doesn't exist then the
    file '/usr/local/share/routino/profiles.xml' (or custom installation
    location) will be used.
  <dt>--loggable
  <dd>Print progress messages that are suitable for logging to a file; normally
    an incrementing counter is printed which is more suitable for real-time
    display than logging.
  <dt>--errorlog[=&lt;name&gt;]
  <dd>Log OSM parsing and processing errors to 'error.log' or the specified file
    name (the '--dir' and '--prefix' options are applied).
  <dt>--parse-only
  <dd>Parse the input files and store them in a temporary file but don't process
    the data into a routing database.
  <dt>--process-only
  <dd>Don't read in any files but process the existing temporary file into the
    routing database.
  <dt>--max-iterations=&lt;number&gt;
  <dd>The maximum number of iterations to use when generating super-nodes and
    super-segments.  Defaults to 5 which is normally enough.
  <dt>--prune-none
  <dd>Disable the prune options below, they can be re-enabled by adding them to
    the command line after this option.
  <dt>--prune-isolated=&lt;length&gt;
  <dd>Remove small disconnected groups of segments (defaults to removing groups
    under 500m).
  <dt>--prune-short=&lt;length&gt;
  <dd>Remove short segments (defaults to removing segments up to a maximum
    length of 5m).
  <dt>--prune-straight=&lt;length&gt;
  <dd>Remove nodes in almost straight highways (defaults to removing nodes up to
    3m offset from a straight line).
  <dt>&lt;filename.osm&gt; ...
  <dd>Specifies the filename(s) to read data from, by default data is read from
    the standard input.
</dl>

<p>
<i>Note: In version 1.4 of Routino the --transport, --not-highway and
--not-property options have been removed.  The same functionality can be
achieved by editing the tagging rules file to not output unwanted data.</i>

<p>
<i>Note: In version 1.5 of Routino the --slim option has been removed but at
compilation time a separate program called <em>planetsplitter-slim</em> is
created that operates in slim mode.  In slim mode the temporary files and
database files are read as needed rather than being mapped into memory.  This
allows a database size greater than 2 GB on 32-bit machines or usage with little
or no virtual memory (e.g. some virtual machines).  The penalty for this is that
the program takes about twice as long to run.</i>

<p>
Example usage:

<pre class="boxed">
./planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb great_britain.osm
</pre>

This will generate the output files 'data/gb-nodes.mem', 'data/gb-segments.mem'
and 'data/gb-ways.mem'.


<h3><a name="H_1_1_2"></a>router</h3>

  <dd>Selects the speed limit in km/hour for each type of highway.  Default
      value depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

  <dd>Selects the percentage preference for using each particular highway
      property
    The value of &lt;property&gt; can be selected from:

      <li>footroute    = A route marked for foot travel
      <li>bicycleroute = A route marked for bicycle travel
    </ul>
    Default value depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.
  <dt>--oneway=[0|1]
  <dd>Selects if the direction of oneway streets are to be obeyed (useful to not
      obey them when walking).  Default value depends on the profile selected by
      the --transport option.
  <dt>--turns=[0|1]
  <dd>Selects if turn restrictions are to be obeyed (useful to not obey them
      when walking).  Default value depends on the profile selected by the
      --transport option.
  <dt>--weight=&lt;weight&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the weight of the mode of transport in tonnes; ensures that the
      weight limit on the highway is not exceeded.  Default value depends on the
      profile selected by the --transport option.
  <dt>--height=&lt;height&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the height of the mode of transport in metres; ensures that the
      height limit on the highway is not exceeded.  Default value depends on the
      profile selected by the --transport option.
  <dt>--width=&lt;width&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the width of the mode of transport in metres; ensures that the
      width limit on the highway is not exceeded.  Default value depends on the
      profile selected by the --transport option.
  <dt>--length=&lt;length&gt;
  <dd>Specifies the length of the mode of transport in metres; ensures that the
      length limit on the highway is not exceeded.  Default value depends on the
      profile selected by the --transport option.
</dl>

<p>
<i>Note: In version 1.5 of Routino a slim option has been added and at
compilation time a separate program called <em>router-slim</em> is created that
operates in slim mode.  In slim mode the database files are read as needed
rather than being mapped into memory.</i>

<p>
The meaning of the &lt;preference&gt; parameter in the command line options is
slightly different for the highway preferences and the property preferences.
For the highway preference consider the choice between two possible highways
between the start and finish when looking for the shortest route.  If highway A
has a preference of 100% and highway B has a preference of 90% then highway A
will be chosen even if it is up to 11% longer (100/90 = 111%).  For the highway
properties each highway either has a particular property or not.  If the
preference for the property is 60% then a highway with the property has a
preference of 77% (sqrt(60%)) and one without has a preference of 63%
(sqrt(100-60%)).  A highway with the property will be chosen even if it is up to
22% longer than one without the property (77/63 = 122%).  The overall preference
for each highway segment is the product of the preference for the highway type
and all of the preferences for the highway properties.

<p>
Example usage (motorbike journey, scenic route, not very fast):

<pre class="boxed">
./router --dir=data --prefix=gb --transport=motorbike --highway-motorway=0 \
         --highway-trunk=0 --speed-primary=80 --speed-secondary=80 --quickest
</pre>

This will use the files 'data/gb-nodes.mem', 'data/gb-segments.mem' and
'data/gb-ways.mem' to find the quickest route by motorbike not using motorways
or trunk roads and not exceeding 80 km/hr.
