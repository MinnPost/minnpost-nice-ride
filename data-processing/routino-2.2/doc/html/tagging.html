<h2><a name="H_1_1"></a>Tags And Attributes</h2>

The different tags and attributes in the 
<a class="ext" title="OpenStreetMap" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OSM</a>
format XML that are used by Routino are described below.

<p>

Routino handles the tags in the input file after they have been processed
according to a set of rules defined in a configuration file.  The first half of
this file describes the tags that are recognised by Routino after being
processed; the second half of the file describes the transformations that are in
the default tagging configuration file.


<!-- ==================== Tags Recognised After Processing ==================== -->


<h2><a name="H_1_2" title="After Processing"></a>Tags Recognised After Processing</h2>

This section describes the tags that are recognised by Routino after the tag
transformations have been applied.  This is therefore a much reduced set of tags
compared to the original OSM data and also includes tags which are specific to
Routino.

<p>

In all cases of tag processing values of <em>true</em>, <em>yes</em>, <em>1</em>
are recognised as being affirmative and any other value is negative.


<!-- ========================= Routino Node Tags ========================= -->

<h3><a name="H_1_2_1" title="Nodes"></a>Node Tags And Attributes</h3>

The node attributes <em>id</em>, <em>latitude</em> and <em>longitude</em> are
used.  The id attribute is required to associate the node with the ways and the
position attributes are required to locate the node.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_1_1" title="transport tags"></a>Transport Specific Tags</h4>

One tag is recognised for each of the different modes of transport: <em>foot</em>,
<em>horse</em>, <em>bicycle</em>, <em>wheelchair</em>, <em>moped</em>,
<em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>, <em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em>
and <em>psv</em>.  These indicate whether the specific type of transport is
allowed to pass through the node or not.

<p>

By default for nodes all types of transport are allowed to pass through a node
and specific tags must be used to remove the permissions for the transport.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_1_2" title="highway (node)"></a>The highway Tag</h4>

The <em>highway</em> tag for <em>mini_roundabout</em> is recognised and used to
improve the description of the route.


<!-- ========================= Routino Way Tags ========================= -->

<h3><a name="H_1_2_2" title="Ways"></a>Way Tags And Attributes</h3>

The tags from the ways in the data are the ones that provide most of the
information for routing.  The <em>id</em> attribute is used only so that the
many segments associated with a way can share a set of tags taken from the way.
The <em>nd</em> information is used to identify the nodes that make up the way.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_1" title="highway (way)"></a>The highway Tag</h4>

The most important tag that is used from a way is the <em>highway</em> tag.
This defines the type of highway that the way represents.  Any way that does not
have a highway tag is discarded.

<p>

There are more highway types defined than are used by the router.  The subset
that the router uses are:

<ul>
  <li>motorway
  <li>trunk
  <li>primary
  <li>secondary
  <li>tertiary
  <li>unclassified
  <li>residential
  <li>service
  <li>track
  <li>cycleway
  <li>path (1)
  <li>steps (2)
</ul>

<p>

<i>
  Note 1: This changed in version 1.3 of Routino - the bridleway and footway
  types were included within the path highway type.
  <br>
  Note 2: This changed in version 1.3 of Routino - the steps type was separated
  from the footway type.
</i>


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_2" title="transport tags"></a>Transport Specific Tags</h4>

One tag is recognised for each of the different modes of transport: <em>foot</em>,
<em>horse</em>, <em>bicycle</em>, <em>wheelchair</em>, <em>moped</em>,
<em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>, <em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em>
and <em>psv</em>.  These indicate whether the specific type of transport is
allowed on the highway or not.

<p>

By default for ways no types of transport are allowed to pass along a highway
and specific tags must be used to add the permissions for the transport.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_3" title="name"></a>The name Tag</h4>

The <em>name</em> tag is used to provide the label for the highway when printing
the results.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_4" title="ref"></a>The ref Tag</h4>

The <em>ref</em> tag is used to provide the label for the highway when printing
the results.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_5" title="multilane"></a>The multilane Tag</h4>

The <em>multilane</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway has multiple
lanes for traffic and this sets one of the highway properties.  There is not
normally a <em>multilane</em> tag but one needs to be added by the tag
processing transformations.  Values of <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em> are expected.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_6" title="paved"></a>The paved Tag</h4>

The <em>paved</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is paved or not,
this is one of the available highway properties.  A <em>paved</em> tag may exist
in the original data but normally the <em>surface</em> tag needs to be
transformed into the <em>paved</em> tag.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_7" title="bridge"></a>The bridge Tag</h4>

The <em>bridge</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is a bridge and
therefore set one of the available properties.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_8" title="tunnel"></a>The tunnel Tag</h4>

The <em>tunnel</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is a tunnel and
therefore set one of the available properties.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_9" title="footroute"></a>The footroute Tag</h4>

The <em>footroute</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is part of a
walking route and therefore set one of the available properties.  This is not a
standard OSM tag and is normally added to the individual highways by looking for
route relations that are designated for foot access.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_10" title="bicycleroute"></a>The bicycleroute Tag</h4>

The <em>bicycleroute</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is part of a
bicycle route and therefore set one of the available properties.  This is not a
standard OSM tag and is normally added to the individual highways by looking for
route relations that are designated for bicycle access.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_11" title="oneway"></a>The oneway Tag</h4>

The <em>oneway</em> tag is used to specify that traffic is only allowed to
travel in one direction.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_12" title="roundabout"></a>The roundabout Tag</h4>

The <em>roundabout</em> tag is used to specify that a highway is part of a
roundabout to improve the description of the calculated route.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_13" title="maxspeed"></a>The maxspeed Tag</h4>

The <em>maxspeed</em> tag is used to specify the maximum speed limit on the
highway; this is always measured in km/hr in OpenStreetMap data.  If the tag
value contains "mph" then it is assumed to be a value in those units and
converted to km/hr.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_14" title="maxweight"></a>The maxweight Tag</h4>

The <em>maxweight</em> tag is used to specify the maximum weight of any traffic
on the highway.  In other words this must be set to the heaviest weight allowed
on the highway (for example a bridge) in tonnes.  If the tag value contains "kg"
then it is assumed that the value is in these units and converted to tonnes.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_15" title="maxheight"></a>The maxheight Tag</h4>

The <em>maxheight</em> tag is used to specify the maximum height of any traffic
on the highway.  In other words this must be set to the lowest height of
anything above the highway (like a bridge) in metres.  If the tag value contains
a measurement in feet or feet and inches then attempts are made to convert this
to metres.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_16" title="maxwidth"></a>The maxwidth Tag</h4>

The <em>maxwidth</em> tag is used to specify the maximum width of any traffic on
the highway.  This must be set to the minimum width of the constraints at the
wayside in metres.  If the tag value contains a measurement in feet or feet and
inches then attempts are made to convert this to metres.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_17" title="maxlength"></a>The maxlength Tag</h4>

The <em>maxlength</em> tag is used to specify the maximum length of any traffic
on the highway (usually from a traffic sign) in metres.  If the tag value
contains a measurement in feet or feet and inches then attempts are made to
convert this to metres.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_2_18" title="area"></a>The area Tag</h4>

The <em>area</em> tag is used to specify that a way defines an area.  This is
used only so that in the case of duplicated segments those belonging to an area
can be discarded in preference to those that are not.


<!-- ========================= Routino Relation Tags ========================= -->

<h3><a name="H_1_2_3" title="Relations"></a>Relation Tags And Attributes</h3>

The tags from the relations are used to associate more properties with the
highways that are part of that relation.  The <em>id</em> attribute is used so
that relations that are members of other relations can be identified.
The <em>member</em> information is used to identify the nodes and ways that make
up the relation.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_3_1" title="footroute"></a>The footroute Tag</h4>

The <em>footroute</em> tag is used to identify whether a relation defines a
walking route and therefore should be applied to the individual member highways.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_3_2" title="bicycleroute"></a>The bicycleroute Tag</h4>

The <em>bicycleroute</em> tag is used to identify whether a relation defines a
bicycle route and therefore should be applied to the individual member highways.


<h4><a name="H_1_2_3_3" title="type, restriction, except"></a>The type, restriction & except Tags</h4>

For turn relations the information about the allowed or disallowed turns are
stored in the <em>type</em>, <em>restriction</em> and <em>except</em> tags.  For
a turn restriction the <em>type</em> must be equal to "restriction",
the <em>restriction</em> must define the type of turn relation
and <em>except</em> defines transport types which are exempt from the
restriction.


<!-- ==================== Tag Transformations ==================== -->

<h2><a name="H_1_3" title="Tag Transformations"></a>Tag Transformations</h2>

This section describes the set of tag transformations that are contained in the
default configuration file.  The configuration file tagging rules are applied in
sequence and this section of the document is arranged in the same order.


<!-- ==================== Node Tag Transformations ==================== -->

<h3><a name="H_1_3_1" title="Nodes"></a>Node Tag Transformations</h3>

<h4><a name="H_1_3_1_1" title="Barrier Defaults"></a>Barrier Defaults</h4>

The first part of the tag transformations is to decide on defaults for each type
of node.  This uses the <em>barrier</em> tag in the OSM file and converts it into
a default set of disallowed transport types.

<p>

<table>
  <caption>Transport types through different barrier types</caption>
  <tr>

    <td class="center">no
</table>

<h4><a name="H_1_3_1_2" title="Generic access"></a>Generic Access Permissions</h4>

The <em>access</em> tag is used to specify the default access restrictions
through the node.  If the tag value is <em>no</em> or <em>private</em>
or <em>limited</em> then all transport types are denied access (later tag
transformation rules may add specific transport types back again).


<h4><a name="H_1_3_1_3" title="Other access"></a>Other Access Permissions</h4>

A tag named <em>vehicle</em> means any of the <em>bicycle</em>, <em>moped</em>,
<em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>, <em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em>
and <em>psv</em> transport types.  A tag named <em>motor_vehicle</em> is
transformed to mean any vehicle except a <em>bicycle</em>.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_1_4" title="Specific access"></a>Specific Access Permissions</h4>

The final part of the access permissions is to use the specific transport type
tags.

<p>

One tag is recognised for each of the different modes of transport: <em>foot</em>,
<em>horse</em>, <em>bicycle</em>, <em>wheelchair</em>, <em>moped</em>,
<em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>, <em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em>
and <em>psv</em>.  These indicate whether the specific type of transport is
allowed through the node or not; the values listed for the <em>access</em> tag
are also accepted here.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_1_5" title="Mini-roundabouts"></a>Mini-roundabouts</h4>

The <em>highway</em> tag for <em>mini_roundabout</em> is passed through without
change.


<!-- ==================== Way Tag Transformations ==================== -->

<h3><a name="H_1_3_2" title="Ways"></a>Way Tag Transformations</h3>


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_1" title="Highway Defaults"></a>Highway Defaults</h4>

The first part of the tag transformations is to decide on defaults for each type
of highway.  This uses the <em>highway</em> tag in the OSM file and maps it into
one of the <em>highway</em> tags that are recognised by Routino, defining the
default allowed transport types and adding a number of properties.

<p>

The first part of the transformation is to convert the highway tag into one that
is recognised by Routino.

<p>

</table>

<i>
  Note 1: A ferry route is converted into a highway of type "ferry" so that
  routes using a ferry can be calculated.
</i>

<p>

The type of highway also determines the defaults for the types of transport
allowed on the highway.  The default assumptions are as shown in the table
below.

<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_2" title="Generic access"></a>Generic Access Permissions</h4>

The <em>access</em> tag is used to specify the default access restrictions on
the highway.  If the tag value is <em>no</em> or <em>private</em> then all
transport types are denied access (later tag transformation rules may add
specific transport types back again).


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_3" title="Other access"></a>Other Access Permissions</h4>

A tag named <em>vehicle</em> means any of the <em>bicycle</em>, <em>moped</em>,
<em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>, <em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em>
and <em>psv</em> transport types.  A tag named <em>motor_vehicle</em> is
transformed to mean any vehicle except a <em>bicycle</em>.

<p>

The <em>designation</em> tag is used as an alternative method of identifying the
legal right of way on a path (in the UK at least).  The tag transformations
convert these tags into a set of allowed transport types as shown below.

<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_4" title="Specific access"></a>Specific Access Permissions</h4>

The final part of the access permissions is to use the specific transport type
tags.

<p>

One tag is recognised for each of the different modes of transport: <em>foot</em>,
<em>horse</em>, <em>bicycle</em>, <em>wheelchair</em>, <em>moped</em>,
<em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>, <em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em>
and <em>psv</em>.  These indicate whether the specific type of transport is
allowed on the highway or not.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_5" title="Properties"></a>Highway Properties</h4>

If there is a surface tag then the highway is assumed to be unpaved unless the
tag value matches one of the following: <em>paved</em>, <em>asphalt</em>,
<em>concrete</em> or many other values listed in the configuration file.

<p>

Support for the obsolete <em>paved</em> tag is also provided and the highway is
paved if this is set to a true value.

<p>

The <em>lanes</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway has multiple lanes
for traffic or not (the number of lanes is not important in this case, only
whether it is more than one) this sets one of the highway properties.

<p>

The <em>bridge</em> and <em>tunnel</em> tags are copied directly from the input
to the output.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_6" title="Restrictions"></a>Highway Restrictions</h4>

The <em>oneway</em>, <em>maxspeed</em>, <em>maxweight</em>, <em>maxheight</em>,
<em>maxwidth</em> and <em>maxlength</em> are copied directly from the input to
the output without modification.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_7" title="Roundabouts"></a>Roundabouts</h4>

If a highway is tagged as <em>junction=roundabout</em> then
a <em>roundabout=yes</em> tag created on the output.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_8" title="Names and Refs"></a>Highway Names and References</h4>

The <em>name</em> and <em>ref</em> tags are copied directly from the input to
the output.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_2_9" title="Areas"></a>Highway Areas</h4>

The <em>area</em> tag is copied directly from the input to the output.


<!-- ==================== Relation Tag Transformations ==================== -->

<h3><a name="H_1_3_3" title="Relations"></a>Relation Tag Transformations</h3>

The <em>type</em> tag is passed through without change.


<h4><a name="H_1_3_3_1" title="Routes"></a>Routes</h4>

The <em>route</em> tag can be used to determine whether a relation is part of a
walking of bicycle route so that the footroute and bicycleroute properties can
be applied to the highways that make up that relation.

<p>

The tag transformations that are applied for route relations are defined in the
table below.

<p>

<h4><a name="H_1_3_3_2" title="Turn Restrictions"></a>Turn Restrictions</h4>

No tag transformations are defined for turn restriction relations but
the <em>restriction</em> and <em>except</em> tags are passed through without
change.
