                               Routino : Usage
                               ===============


   There are four programs that make up this software. The first one takes
   the planet.osm datafile from OpenStreetMap (or other source of data
   using the same formats) and converts it into a local database. The
   second program uses the database to determine an optimum route between
   two points. The third program allows visualisation of the data and
   statistics to be extracted. The fourth program is a test program for
   the tag transformations.


planetsplitter
--------------

   This program reads in the OSM format XML file and splits it up to
   create the database that is used for routing.

   Usage: planetsplitter [--help]
                         [--dir=<dirname>] [--prefix=<name>]
                         [--sort-ram-size=<size>]
                         [--tmpdir=<dirname>]
                         [--tagging=<filename>]
                         [--loggable] [--errorlog[=<name>]]
                         [--parse-only | --process-only]
                         [--max-iterations=<number>]
                         [--prune-none]
                         [--prune-isolated=<len>]
                         [--prune-short=<len>]
                         [--prune-straight=<len>]
                         [<filename.osm> ...]

   --help
          Prints out the help information.

   --dir=<dirname>
          Sets the directory name in which to save the results. Defaults
          to the current directory.

   --prefix=<name>
          Sets the filename prefix for the files that are created.
          Defaults to no prefix.

   --sort-ram-size=<size>
          Specifies the amount of RAM (in MB) to use for sorting the data.
          If not specified then 64 MB will be used in slim mode or 256 MB
          otherwise.

   --tmpdir=<dirname>
          Specifies the name of the directory to store the temporary disk
          files. If not specified then it defaults to either the value of
          the --dir option or the current directory.

   --tagging=<filename>
          Sets the filename containing the list of tagging rules in XML
          format for the parsing the input files. If the file doesn't
          exist then dirname, prefix and "profiles.xml" will be combined
          and used, if that doesn't exist then the file
          '/usr/local/share/routino/profiles.xml' (or custom installation
          location) will be used.

   --loggable
          Print progress messages that are suitable for logging to a file;
          normally an incrementing counter is printed which is more
          suitable for real-time display than logging.

   --errorlog[=<name>]
          Log OSM parsing and processing errors to 'error.log' or the
          specified file name (the '--dir' and '--prefix' options are
          applied).

   --parse-only
          Parse the input files and store them in a temporary file but
          don't process the data into a routing database.

   --process-only
          Don't read in any files but process the existing temporary file
          into the routing database.

   --max-iterations=<number>
          The maximum number of iterations to use when generating
          super-nodes and super-segments. Defaults to 5 which is normally
          enough.

   --prune-none
          Disable the prune options below, they can be re-enabled by
          adding them to the command line after this option.

   --prune-isolated=<length>
          Remove small disconnected groups of segments (defaults to
          removing groups under 500m).

   --prune-short=<length>
          Remove short segments (defaults to removing segments up to a
          maximum length of 5m).

   --prune-straight=<length>
          Remove nodes in almost straight highways (defaults to removing
          nodes up to 3m offset from a straight line).

   <filename.osm> ...
          Specifies the filename(s) to read data from, by default data is
          read from the standard input.

   Note: In version 1.4 of Routino the --transport, --not-highway and
   --not-property options have been removed. The same functionality can be
   achieved by editing the tagging rules file to not output unwanted data.

   Note: In version 1.5 of Routino the --slim option has been removed but
   at compilation time a separate program called planetsplitter-slim is
   created that operates in slim mode. In slim mode the temporary files
   and database files are read as needed rather than being mapped into
   memory. This allows a database size greater than 2 GB on 32-bit
   machines or usage with little or no virtual memory (e.g. some virtual
   machines). The penalty for this is that the program takes about twice
   as long to run.

   Example usage:

   ./planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb great_britain.osm

   This will generate the output files 'data/gb-nodes.mem',
   'data/gb-segments.mem' and 'data/gb-ways.mem'.


router
------

   This program performs the calculation of the optimum routes using the
   database generated by the planetsplitter program.

   Usage: router [--help | --help-profile | --help-profile-xml |
                           --help-profile-json | --help-profile-perl ]

          Prints out all the loaded profiles as an XML file in the same
          format that can be loaded in.

   --help-profile-json
          Prints out all the loaded profiles in JavaScript Object Notation
          (JSON) format for use in the interactive webpage.

          the router CGI.

   --dir=<dirname>
          Sets the directory name in which to read the local database.
          Defaults to the current directory.

   --prefix=<name>
          Sets the filename prefix for the files in the local database.
          Defaults to no prefix.

   --profiles=<filename>
          Sets the filename containing the list of routing profiles in XML
          format. If the file doesn't exist then dirname, prefix and
          "profiles.xml" will be combined and used, if that doesn't exist
          then the file '/usr/local/share/routino/profiles.xml' (or custom
          installation location) will be used.

   --translations=<filename>
          Sets the filename containing the list of translations in XML
          format for the output files. If the file doesn't exist then
          dirname, prefix and "translations.xml" will be combined and
          used, if that doesn't exist then the file
          '/usr/local/share/routino/translations.xml' (or custom
          installation location) will be used.

   --exact-nodes-only
          When processing the specified latitude and longitude points only
          select the nearest node instead of finding the nearest point
          within a segment (quicker but less accurate unless the points
          are already near nodes).

   --loggable
          Print progress messages that are suitable for logging to a file;
          normally an incrementing counter is printed which is more
          suitable for real-time display than logging.

   --quiet
          Don't generate any screen output while running (useful for
          running in a script).

   --language=<lang>
          Select the language specified from the file of translations. If
          this option is not given and the file exists then the first
          language in the file will be used. If this option is not given
          and no file exists the compiled-in default language (English)
          will be used.

   --output-html
   --output-gpx-track
   --output-gpx-route
   --output-text
   --output-text-all
          Generate the selected output file formats (HTML, GPX track file,
          GPX route file, plain text route and/or plain text with all
          nodes). If no output is specified then all are generated,
          specifying any automatically disables those not specified.

   --output-none
          Do not generate any output or read in any translations files.

   --profile=<name>
          Specifies the name of the profile to use.

   --transport=<transport>
          Select the type of transport to use, <transport> can be set to:

          + foot = Foot
          + horse = Horse
          + wheelchair = Wheelchair
          + bicycle = Bicycle
          + moped = Moped (Small motorbike, limited speed)
          + motorbike = Motorbike
          + motorcar = Motorcar
          + goods = Goods (Small lorry, van)
          + hgv = HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicle - large lorry)
          + psv = PSV (Public Service Vehicle - bus, coach)

          Defaults to 'motorcar', this option also selects the default
          profile information if the '--profile' option is not given and a
          profile matching the transport name is found.

   --shortest
          Find the shortest route between the waypoints.

   --quickest
          Find the quickest route between the waypoints.

   --lon1=<longitude>, --lat1=<latitude>
   --lon2=<longitude>, --lat2=<latitude>
   ... --lon99=<longitude>, --lat99=<latitude>
          The location of the waypoints that make up the start, middle and
          end points of the route. Up to 99 waypoints can be specified and
          the route will pass through each of the specified ones in
          sequence. The algorithm will use the closest node or point
          within a segment that allows the specified traffic type.

   --heading=<bearing>
          Specifies the initial direction of travel at the start of the
          route (from the lowest numbered waypoint) as a compass bearing
          from 0 to 360 degrees.

   --highway-<highway>=<preference>
          Selects the percentage preference for using each particular type
          of highway. The value of <highway> can be selected from:

          + motorway = Motorway
          + trunk = Trunk
          + primary = Primary
          + secondary = Secondary
          + tertiary = Tertiary
          + unclassified = Unclassified
          + residential = Residential
          + service = Service
          + track = Track
          + cycleway = Cycleway
          + path = Path
          + steps = Steps
          + ferry = Ferry

          Default value depends on the profile selected by the --transport
          option.

   --speed-<highway>=<speed>
          Selects the speed limit in km/hour for each type of highway.
          Default value depends on the profile selected by the --transport
          option.

   --property-<property>=<preference>
          Selects the percentage preference for using each particular
          highway property The value of <property> can be selected from:

          + paved = Paved (suitable for normal wheels)
          + multilane = Multiple lanes
          + bridge = Bridge
          + tunnel = Tunnel
          + footroute = A route marked for foot travel
          + bicycleroute = A route marked for bicycle travel

          Default value depends on the profile selected by the --transport
          option.

   --oneway=[0|1]
          Selects if the direction of oneway streets are to be obeyed
          (useful to not obey them when walking). Default value depends on
          the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --turns=[0|1]
          Selects if turn restrictions are to be obeyed (useful to not
          obey them when walking). Default value depends on the profile
          selected by the --transport option.

   --weight=<weight>
          Specifies the weight of the mode of transport in tonnes; ensures
          that the weight limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default
          value depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --height=<height>
          Specifies the height of the mode of transport in metres; ensures
          that the height limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default
          value depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --width=<width>
          Specifies the width of the mode of transport in metres; ensures
          that the width limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default
          value depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --length=<length>
          Specifies the length of the mode of transport in metres; ensures
          that the length limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default
          value depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   Note: In version 1.5 of Routino a slim option has been added and at
   compilation time a separate program called router-slim is created that
   operates in slim mode. In slim mode the database files are read as
   needed rather than being mapped into memory.

   The meaning of the <preference> parameter in the command line options
   is slightly different for the highway preferences and the property
   preferences. For the highway preference consider the choice between two
   possible highways between the start and finish when looking for the
   shortest route. If highway A has a preference of 100% and highway B has
   a preference of 90% then highway A will be chosen even if it is up to
   11% longer (100/90 = 111%). For the highway properties each highway
   either has a particular property or not. If the preference for the
   property is 60% then a highway with the property has a preference of
   77% (sqrt(60%)) and one without has a preference of 63%
   (sqrt(100-60%)). A highway with the property will be chosen even if it
   is up to 22% longer than one without the property (77/63 = 122%). The
   overall preference for each highway segment is the product of the
   preference for the highway type and all of the preferences for the
   highway properties.

   Example usage (motorbike journey, scenic route, not very fast):

   ./router --dir=data --prefix=gb --transport=motorbike --highway-motorway=0 \
            --highway-trunk=0 --speed-primary=80 --speed-secondary=80 --quickest

   This will use the files 'data/gb-nodes.mem', 'data/gb-segments.mem' and
   'data/gb-ways.mem' to find the quickest route by motorbike not using
   motorways or trunk roads and not exceeding 80 km/hr.


filedumper
----------

   This program is used to extract statistics from the database, extract
   particular information for visualisation purposes or for dumping the
   database contents.
